Just a quick one! Font Awesome provides a nice set of icons for jazzing up your UI, but a commonly asked question is how to line up the icons with adjacent text. Two CSS properties can help.

```
.icon {
    white-space: nowrap;
    vertical-align: middle;
}
```

`white-space: nowrap` ensures that an icon will stay on the same line as adjacent text and not break onto another line, and `vertical-align: middle` ensures that icons are on the same horizontal axis as adjacent text.
