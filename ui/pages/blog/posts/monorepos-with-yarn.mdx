<Post backgroundImage="align.jpg" title="A-version to showing up in Yarn monorepos" author="Matthew C Wake">
    I've been using Yarn as a package manager for maintaining my shiny new monorepo. Picking up new workspaces should simply be a case of something like below in your <code>package.json</code>:
    ```js
        {
            ...
            "workspaces":[
                "api/*",
                "lib/*",
                "tools/*",
                "ui"
            ]
            ...
        }
    ```
    ...and then for each subject you just do <code>yarn init</code> and then add the dependencies as normal, right? Almost.

    In order to be a functioning monorepo, Yarn checks version numbers of each package against the specified dependencies. To do that, it needs a version number. And guess what <code>yarn init</code> doesn't add by default? Version number.

    So if you're working with a monorepo and can't figure out which it won't recognise the existence of one of your sub-projects, chances are you might just be missing the version number.
