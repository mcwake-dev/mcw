Font Awesome provides a nice set of icons for jazzing up your
UI, but they can end up out of alignment with accompanying text. Two CSS properties can help.

```css
.icon {
  white-space: nowrap;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

white-space: nowrap ensures that an icon will stay on the same line
as adjacent text and not break onto another line, and vertical-align: middle ensures
that icons are on the same horizontal axis as adjacent text.
