<Post backgroundImage="prism.jpg" title="Prisma with NX Monorepo" author="Matthew C Wake">

Microservices and micro-frontends are a neat way of splitting big clunky webapps into neat, manageable chunks. Monorepos are a neat way of sharing code between different microservices, and spare you the hassle of bouncing between repo A and B and C. NX is a neat tool for managing your monorepo. Prisma is a versatile and type-safe ORM. But try to use them all together, and there's a problem...

By default when running `prisma generate` any previously generated Prisma client
in your `node_modules` folder. That unfortunately means that if you have
multiple microserves with multiple Prisma clients, you end up overwriting the
client for service A with the client for service B.
However, there is fortunately a simple solution to this, found on [Prisma's Github](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7470).
In your `schema.prisma` file, you can add an output line in your `generator` block:

```
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../../node_modules/@prisma/client/[a descriptive, unique name for your client]"
}
```

You can then import this as normal:

```
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client/[your descriptive, unique name for your client]";
```

And away you go, Prisma microservices that won't overwrite each other.
